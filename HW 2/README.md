# Text-Analytics

This assignment was done in collaboration with Sagar Chadha, Ryan Hoff, Lu Hao Kuo, and Akhilesh Reddy from the UT MSBA class of 2019 for the Text Analytics course.

The objective of this assignment was to scrape the Edmunds luxury car forum and conduct analysis on user comments. The most frequently mentioned brands and features (i.e. comfort features, efficiency features, etc.) were found. Lift values were calculated for each brand in relation to other brands, as well as in relation the various features. Insights for the different brands were generated using these lift scores.

In this project, we found that the most mentioned luxury car brands on the Edmunds forum are: BMW, Audi, and Acura. We also found that Ford and Volkswagen are the most differentiated brands when compared to the others mentioned on the forum. The users on Edmunds are mostly concerned with performance and comfort features, with Audi and Mercedes as the leaders in these two areas, respectively. Finally, we concluded that Honda is the most positively received brand in terms of its features on Edmunds, and even found that many Edmunds users express a desire for what Honda has to offer.
